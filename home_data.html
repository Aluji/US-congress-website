            <h4>About us</h4>
            <p>
              Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
              transparency. In a free society, transparency is government's
              obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart
              of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at
              TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how
              officials conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money
              must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency
              allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes
              accountability and provides information for citizens about what
              their Government is doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also believe that government should be participatory. Public
              engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves
              the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
              society, and public officials benefit from having access to that
              dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become
              actively engaged in American government.
            </p>
            <p>
              TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can
              readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify
              information of greatest use to the public.
            </p>
            <h4>Background History of Government Transparency</h4>
            <p>
              In the West, the idea that government should be open to public
              scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to
              the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an
              attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of
              their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative
              instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with
              Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a
              Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as
              part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This
              approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly
              related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public
              sphere.
            </p>

            <p>
              Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America
              (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined
              provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and
              freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth
              century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these
              measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal
              politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among
              the latter.
            </p>

            <p>
              Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of
              contemporary democratic practice and is often linked to the
              passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian
              countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information
              legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the
              eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of
              openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
              Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
              legislation in 1999).
            </p>

            <p>
              The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in
              1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws
              were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
